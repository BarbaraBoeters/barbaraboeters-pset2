Description: “Mad Libs” are short stories that have blanks called placeholders to be filled in. In the non-computerized version of this game, you ask someone to fill in each of the placeholders without telling them anything about the overall story. Once all placeholders are filled in, you show them the resulting silly story.

Requirements: There were soms specific requirements to fulfill. I had to use an existing file with swift code where they already defined the Story class. In the second and third view controllers we had to define this class first. The app has to prompt the user for input and use it to complete the story. And last but not least this app supports rotation of the user interface
